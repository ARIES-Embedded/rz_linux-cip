Renesas RZ/G2L Camera Receiving Unit driver (rzg2l-cru)
------------------------------------------------------

The rzg2l-cru device provides receiving data output from camera and
convert capabilities for the Renesas RZ/G2L family of devices.

CRU has 2 blocks: CSI2 receiver and image processing block. Image processing
block can receive video data from the external Digital Parallel Interface that
support YUV video with both external synchronization and BT.656
synchronization for the latter.

 - compatible: Must be one or more of the following
   - "renesas,cru-r9a07g044l" for the R9A07G044L device.
   - "renesas,cru-rzg2l" for the generic RZ/G2L device.
   - "renesas,cru-r9a07g043u" for the R9A07G043U (RZ/G2UL) device.
 - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
 - interrupts: the interrupt for the device
 - clocks: Reference to the parent clock
 - reset: Reference to the reset block.

The per-board settings:
RZ/G2L can only support a single connected parallel input source from external
SoC pins (port@0) or a parallel input source from local SoC CSI-2 receiver
(port@1) depending on SoC.

- ports
    - port@0 - sub-node describing a single endpoint connected to the CRU
      from external SoC pins as described in video-interfaces.txt[1].

    - port@1 - sub-nodes describing a single endpoint connected to the CRU
      from local SoC CSI-2 receiver.

Device node example
-------------------

	cru: video@10830000 {
		compatible = "renesas,cru-r9a07g044l", "renesas,cru-rzg2l";
		reg = <0 0x10830000 0 0x400>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A07G044L_CLK_CRU>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 167 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		resets = <&cpg R9A07G044L_CLK_CRU>;
		power-domains = <&cpg>;
		status = "disabled";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;

				cru_to_parallel: endpoint {
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;

				cru_to_csi2: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&csi2_to_cru>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
