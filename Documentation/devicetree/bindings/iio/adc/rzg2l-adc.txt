Renesas RZ/G2L A/D Converter bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "renesas,rzg2l-adc"

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
       region.
- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
              depends on the interrupt controller.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- #io-channel-cells: Should be 1, see ../iio-bindings.txt
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names if need support
	  this option. See ../reset/reset.txt for details.

Example:
	adc: adc@10059000 {
		compatible = "renesas,rzg2l-adc";
		reg = <0 0x10059000 0 0x400>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 347  IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A07G044L_CLK_ADC>;
		resets = <&cpg R9A07G044L_CLK_ADC>;
		power-domains = <&cpg>;
	};
