* Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller Device Tree bindings for RZG2L

* DMA controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "renesas,<soctype>-dma".
	Below is soctypes supported:
	  - "renesas,r9a07g044l-dma" (RZ/G2L)
	  - "renesas,r9a07g054l-dma" (RZ/V2L)
- reg : First item should be contain DMA channel 0 base registers location and
  length.Second item should be DMA Extension Resource Selectors registers
  location and length
- interrupts : Interrupt specifiers for the DMAC, one for each entry in
  interrupt-names
- interrupt-names: One entry for the error interrupt, named "error", plus one
  entry per channel, named "ch%u", where %u is the channel number ranging from
  zero to the number of channels minus one
- dma-channels : Number of DMA channels supported. Should be 16
- #dma-cells : Has to be 1. rzg2l-dma does not support anything else

- clocks:  phandle + clock-specifier pairs for DMA functional clock
- resets: Reference to a reset controller asserting the DMA controller
Example:

	dma0: dma-controller@11800000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r9a07g044l-dma";
		reg =   <0 0x11820000 0 0x10000>,
			<0 0x11830000 0 0x10000>;

		interrupts =    <GIC_SPI 125 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 126 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 127 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 128 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 129 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 130 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 131 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 132 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 133 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 134 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 136 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 137 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 138 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 139 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 140 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 141 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "ch0", "ch1", "ch2", "ch3",
			"ch4", "ch5", "ch6", "ch7",
			"ch8", "ch9", "ch10", "ch11",
			"ch12", "ch13", "ch14", "ch15",
			"error";
		dma-channels = <16>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A07G044L_CLK_DMAC>;
		resets = <&cpg R9A07G044L_CLK_DMAC>;
	};

* DMA client

Clients have to specify the DMA requests with phandles in a list.

Required properties:
- dmas: List of one or more DMA request specifiers. One DMA request specifier
  consists of a phandle to the DMA controller followed by the number
  specifying the module request type. The number includes 8 bits MSB MID
  and 4 bits LSB RID.
- dma-names: List of string identifiers for the DMA requests. For the correct
  names, have a look at the specific client driver.

Example:

	&ssi0 {
		...
		dmas = <&dma0 0x9501>,
			<&dma0 0x9502>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		...
	};
