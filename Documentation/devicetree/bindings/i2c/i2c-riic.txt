Device tree configuration for Renesas RIIC driver

Required properties:
- compatible      :
	"renesas,riic-r9a07g044l" if the device is a part of a R9A07G044L SoC.
	"renesas,riic-r7s72100" if the device is a part of a R7S72100 SoC.
	"renesas,riic-rz" for a generic RZ/A1, RZ/A2 or RZ/G2L compatible device.

	When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first followed
	by the generic version.

- reg             : address start and address range size of device
- interrupts      : 8 interrupts (TEI, RI, TI, SPI, STI, NAKI, ALI, TMOI)
- clock-frequency : frequency of bus clock in Hz
- #address-cells  : should be <1>
- #size-cells     : should be <0>

Pinctrl properties might be needed, too. See there.

Example:

	i2c0: i2c@fcfee000 {
		compatible = "renesas,riic-r7s72100", "renesas,riic-rz";
		reg = <0xfcfee000 0x44>;
		interrupts = <0 157 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 158 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			     <0 159 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			     <0 160 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 161 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 162 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 163 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 164 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
